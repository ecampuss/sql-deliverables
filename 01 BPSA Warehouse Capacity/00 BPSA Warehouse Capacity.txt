This codes perform an analysis of warehouse capacity across different locations in the company. It calculates current stock levels, future sales orders, and available storage capacity for cans and ends over a 30-day horizon. The logic compares stock utilization and sales projections to warehouse capacity, and generates indicators such as daily balance (stock minus sales) and warehouse occupation rate. The goal is to provide visibility into whether each warehouse will have sufficient space to meet future operational needs.
