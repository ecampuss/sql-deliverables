The second part of the TCO queries is designed to support financial reporting and uncover improvement opportunities based on the data provided by application leaders. These queries analyze the submitted cost data to detect inconsistencies and inefficiencies, such as applications assigned to multiple owners, systems with zero reported costs, and incorrect or missing cost center assignments. This analysis helps identify areas where cost transparency can be improved and where potential savings or process enhancements can be explored.
