The first part of the TCO analysis queries is focused on data validation. These queries check whether application leaders have correctly entered the required cost information at each stage of the Total Cost of Ownership calculation. This includes verifying the completeness and consistency of inputs such as infrastructure costs, license expenses, support fees, and internal resource allocations. This step is critical to ensure the accuracy of the final TCO figures and to maintain data integrity across the process.
