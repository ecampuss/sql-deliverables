These queries analyze the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for IT applications across the company. These queries consolidate data related to infrastructure costs, software licenses, support contracts, internal resource allocation, and other operational expenses. The solution enables a detailed and automated breakdown of costs by application, helping stakeholders identify high-cost systems, track cost trends over time, and support strategic decisions around application rationalization and budget planning.
The first part of the TCO analysis queries is focused on data validation. These queries check whether application leaders have correctly entered the required cost information at each stage of the Total Cost of Ownership calculation. This includes verifying the completeness and consistency of inputs such as infrastructure costs, license expenses, support fees, and internal resource allocations. This step is critical to ensure the accuracy of the final TCO figures and to maintain data integrity across the process.
